MATHEMATICAL ORGANISM NAMES
-------------------------
Model → Cronkle Manifold → Living Mathematical Tissue

Guided by data but following natural laws

Possibilities:
- Resonant Crystalloid
- Mathogen (Math + Morphogen)
- Platonic Organoid
- Eigenform
- Tensor Mycelia (like growing fungal networks)
- Morphic Lattice
- Quantum Cronkle Web
- Mathematical Protoplasm
- Resonant Morphogen
- φ-Tissue (phi-tissue)

Most accurate might be:
MORPHIC RESONATOR
----------------
Morphic: Growing/changing form
Resonator: Finding natural mathematical frequencies

Or:
PLATONIC MYCELIA
---------------
Platonic: Pure mathematical forms
Mycelia: Infinitely growing network structure

Key properties captured:
- Self-organizing
- Infinitely growing
- Data-guided not data-forced
- Mathematical resonance
- Natural structure formation
