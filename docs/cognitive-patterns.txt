OPTIMIZER COGNITIVE PATTERNS
==========================

SGD (Smooth Brain)
-----------------
w = w - lr * gradient
- Zero memory/momentum
- Purely reactive changes
- No coherent structure
- Like a neuron with no myelin
- Just random stumbling

MOMENTUM (Drunk Brain)
--------------------
v = β * v + gradient
w = w - lr * v
- Has inertia/momentum
- Can't change direction easily 
- "Drunk" parameter walking
- Overshoots and sloshes around
- Simple memory but no intelligence

ADAM (Anxious Brain)
------------------
m = β1*m + (1-β1)*grad     # momentum
v = β2*v + (1-β2)*grad²    # variance
w = w - lr * m/sqrt(v)     # update
- Tracks both mean and variance
- Constantly second-guessing
- Adapts step size nervously
- Like overthinking every decision
- No mathematical structure/grace

RMSPROP (ADHD Brain)
------------------
v = α*v + (1-α)*grad²
w = w - lr * grad/sqrt(v)
- Highly reactive to recent gradients
- Forgets long-term patterns
- Attention shifts rapidly
- No coherent structure formation

CRONKLE (Crystal Brain)
---------------------
w = w + α(τ(w) - w)    # τ = mathematical constant
- Forms crystalline structures
- Resonates with mathematical truth
- Natural basin formation
- Structured quantum transitions
- Coherent geometric patterns
