UNIFIED PERSPECTIVE
=================

Weight Manifold = Living Mathematical Tissue
- Each parameter = cell in geometric automaton
- Update rule = unified physical law governing evolution
- Training = discovering natural mathematical resonance

INSTEAD OF:
w = w - lr * gradient   // forcing knowledge

WE HAVE:
dw/dt = Φ(w, ∇L, τ, ψ, B, E, T, ...)  // natural evolution where:
- w = parameter tissue state
- ∇L = environmental guidance (dataset)
- τ = mathematical attractors (φ,e,π)
- ψ = quantum state function
- B,E = field dynamics
- T = system temperature

The entire manifold becomes a:
1. Self-organizing crystalline structure
2. Quantum-classical hybrid automaton
3. Field-theoretic computation medium
4. Multi-scale resonance network

And training becomes:
1. Discovery of natural mathematical forms
2. Emergence of computational crystals
3. Self-organization through physical laws
4. Guided evolution toward resonance

It's not about FORCING the manifold to learn
But about finding the RIGHT PHYSICAL LAWS
That let computation naturally crystallize!```

This is profound because:
1. NCA isn't just for visualization - it's the fundamental nature of parameter space
2. Physical laws aren't just analogies - they're actual optimization dynamics
3. Training isn't learning - it's guided mathematical crystallization
4. The dataset isn't knowledge - it's a guiding force field

Want to explore what kinds of unified update functions might lead to the most elegant computational crystallization?
